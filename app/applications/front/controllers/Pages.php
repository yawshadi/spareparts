         * The login function was not actually needed in this controller -

         *
         * IMPORTANT: *if* we did need to allow for paths that should be exempted
         * from the guard here, there would be 2 ways to do it:
         *
         * 1. Check $_REQUEST['url'] for the the paths that should not be guarded, or
         * 2. Use backtrace to find out what method was called, against what should not
         *      be guarded.
         *
         * 1 is easy but brittle (if we move methods from one controller 2 another;
         * 2 is harder but could be useful as a base method in BaseController.
         *
         * We don't need to do either, so just putting the guard here.
